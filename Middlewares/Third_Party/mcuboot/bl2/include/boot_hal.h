 *        dependent:
 *        - Overwritten with a pre-defined constant value (i.e.: 0).
 *        - Overwritten with a random value.
 *        - Change the secret if its location is known.
 *        - Set a register which can hide some part of the flash/RAM against
 *          next stage software components.
 *        - Etc.
