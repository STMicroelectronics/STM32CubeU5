## <b>Fx_File_Edit_Standalone Application Description</b>

This application provides an example of FileX stack usage on NUCLEO-U545RE-Q board, running in standalone mode (without ThreadX). It demonstrates how to create a Fat File system on the internal SRAM memory using FileX API.

The application is designed to execute file operations on the SRAM-Disk device, it provides all required software code for properly managing it.

The application's main calls the MX_FileX_Init() function in order to Initialize FileX, format the SRAM memory as FAT and open the sram_disk driver. The resulting file system is a FAT32 compatible, with 512 bytes per sector.

Upon successful opening of the created SRAM-Disk media, FileX continues with creating a file called "STM32.TXT" into the root directory by calling MX_FileX_Process(VOID *arg) function, then writes into it some predefined data. The file is re-opened in read only mode and content is checked.

As stated earlier, the present application runs in standalone mode without ThreadX, for this reason, the standalone variant of fileX is used, plus the following flags need to be set in fx_user.h:
  #define FX_SINGLE_THREAD
  #define FX_STANDALONE_ENABLE

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

Successful operation is marked by a toggling green LED light.

Also, information regarding executing operation on the SRAM-Disk is printed to the serial port.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

On failure, an error message is printed to the serial port while the green LED is switched OFF.

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>

None

#### <b>Known limitations</b>

None

### <b>Notes</b>

 1. The created SRAM-Disk, is placed in SRAM4(16 KB) starting from the(SRAM4_BASE=@0x28000000).
 2. User can change the location of the SRAM-Disk by modifying FX_SRAM_DISK_BASE_ADDRESS.

#### <b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b>

- When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a valid filesystem.

### <b>Keywords</b>

FileX, File System, FAT32, SRAM

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This application runs on STM32U545xx devices
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U545RE-Q boards revision: MB1841-D01
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - This application uses USART1 to display logs, the hyperterminal configuration is as follows:

    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - Stop Bit = 1
    - Parity = none
    - Flow control = None

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
