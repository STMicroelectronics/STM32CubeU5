<p>The TFM application components are licensed by ST under Ultimate

<h1 id="tfm-application-description"><b>TFM Application
Description</b></h1>
<p>The TFM provides a Root of Trust solution including Secure Boot and
Secure Firmware Update functionalities that is used before executing the
application and provides TFM secure services that are isolated from the
non-secure application but can be used by the non-secure application at
run-time.</p>
<p>TFM application is based on the Open Source TF-M reference
implementation that has been ported on STM32 microcontroller to take
benefit of STM32 HW security features such as CM33 Trust Zone/MPU, Trust
Zone aware peripherals, Memory protections (HDP, WRP) and enhanced life
cycle scheme. Security features can be enforced with the usage of a ST
secure element, called STSAFE device (precisely STSAFE-A series) which
offers strong authentication, secure TLS sessions, verification of
signatures and secure storage.</p>
<p>The Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update solution allows the update
of the STM32 microcontroller built-in program with new firmware
versions, adding new features and correcting potential issues. The
update process is performed in a secure way to prevent unauthorized
updates and access to confidential on-device data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Secure Boot (Root of Trust services) is an immutable code,
always executed after a system reset, that checks STM32 static
protections, activates STM32 runtime protections and then verifies the
authenticity (RSA or ECDSA signature) and integrity (SHA256) of the
application code before execution in order to ensure that invalid or
malicious code cannot be run. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA)
is taken from TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Src\keys.c and is embedded in the
provisioned data area in the secure boot and secure firmware update
binary.</p></li>
<li><p>The Secure Firmware Update application is an immutable code that
detects that a new firmware image is available, and that checks its
authenticity and integrity. It also decrypts it (AES-CTR) during
installation, if image is installed in internal flash. The AES-CTR key
is encrypted (RSA-OAEP or ECIES-P256) and provided in the firmware image
itself. The default asymmetric key (RSA or ECDSA) used to encrypt the
AES-CTR key is distinct from the signature key, but also taken from
TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Src\keys.c. The firmware update can be done either on the
secure part of firmware image and/or on the non-secure part of the
firmware image.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The secure services are an updatable code implementing a set of
services managing critical assets that are isolated from the non-secure
application so that the non-secure application can’t access directly to
any of the critical assets but can only use secure services that use the
critical assets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Crypto: secure cryptographic services based on opaque key
APIs</p></li>
<li><p>Secure Storage: protect data
Confidentiality/authenticity/Integrity</p></li>
<li><p>Internal Trusted Storage: protect data in internal flash</p></li>
<li><p>Attestation: prove product identity via Entity Attestation
Token</p>
<p>When STSAFE is enabled, EAT contains the STSAFE-A unique serial
number as product identity and message is signed with the STSAFE
pre-provisioned private key.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h2>
<p>Several steps to run TFM application :</p>
<p><b>0. Prerequisite</b></p>
<p>Two versions of imgtool (used during build process) are available in
mcuboot middleware: windows executable and python version. By default,
the windows executable is selected. It is possible to switch to python
version by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>installing python (Python 3.6 or newer) with the required modules
from Middlewares\Third_Party\mcuboot\scripts\requirements.txt:</p>
<pre><code>   pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre></li>
<li><p>having python in execution path variable</p></li>
<li><p>deleting imgtool.exe in
Middlewares\Third_Party\mcuboot\scripts\dist\imgtool</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>1. Build</b></p>
<p>Build the TFM projects in the following order. This is mandatory as
each projects requests some objects generated by the compilation of the

<p>The TFM Secure data signed image contains initial attestation private
key for TFM service. The TFM Non Secure data signed image contains dummy
data for this example.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>2. Initialize the device</b></p>
<p>Ensure the switch SW1 (BOOT0 pin) on B-U585I-IOT02A board is on
position 0 to boot from Flash.</p>
<p>Depending on your toolchain, execute regression script (relying on
STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily perform device initialization in
one shot:</p>
<pre><code>    EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\regression.bat
    MDK-ARM:      TFM_SBSFU_Boot\MDK-ARM\regression.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\regression.sh</code></pre>
<p>As an alternative, it is also possible to initialize and verify
manually the Option Bytes by means of STM32CubeProgrammer GUI tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please ensure with STM32CubeProgammer the following Option bytes
configuration for the device:
<ul>
<li>RDP = 0xAA (RDP Level 0)</li>
<li>DBANK = 1 (Dual bank mode enabled)</li>
<li>SWAP_BANK = 0 (Bank1 and Bank2 are not swapped)</li>
<li>nSWBOOT0 = 1 (BOOT0 taken from BOOT0 pin)</li>
<li>TZEN = 1 (TrustZone security enabled)</li>
<li>NSBOOTADD0 = 0x100000 (User flash address 0x08000000)</li>
<li>NSBOOTADD1 = 0x17F200 (System bootloader address 0x0BF90000)</li>
<li>SECBOOTADD0 = 0x1800c0 (boot entry point address 0xc006000)</li>
<li>SRAM2_RST = 0 (SRAM2 erased at each reset)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure also that these protections are all disabled in the Option
Bytes configuration: BOOT_LOCK, HDP, WRP, SECWM.</li>
<li>Ensure also that device is mass erased.</li>
<li>Ensure also that OEM2LOCK bit in the FLASH_NSSR register is not set
to be sure that any OEM2KEY was provisioned previously. If it is locked
with another password, fill the regression script with this
password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the anti-tamper protection being enabled with active
tamper pins usage by default, it is needed to connect TAMP_IN8 (PE4 on
CN3 pin 11) and TAMP_OUT8 (PE5 on CN3 pin 14) on the B-U585I-IOT02A
board, to allow the application to run. In case the tamper pins are
opened or shorted, then the application is reset and blocked. It is
however possible to disable the anti-tamper protection (refer to section
9)</p>
<p><b>3. Use a terminal emulator</b></p>
<p>Serial port configuration should be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Baud rate = 115200</li>
<li>Data = 8 bits</li>
<li>Parity = none</li>
<li>Stop = 1 bit</li>
<li>Flow control = none</li>
</ul>
<p>Terminal emulator is used for UART connection with the board. Connect
terminal emulator to COM port of the board. The terminal emulator is
used to log TFM information, and enter commands for User
application.</p>
<p><b>4. Program the TFM into flash</b></p>
<p>Program the TFM_SBSFU_Boot binary, the clear signed TFM_Appli Secure
image for initial installation, the clear signed TFM_Appli Non Secure
image for initial installation, and TFM_Loader image into internal
flash.</p>
<p>Program as well the TFM Secure and Non Secure data signed images for
initial installation into internal flash.</p>
<p>Depending on your toolchain, execute script TFM_UPDATE (relying on
STM32CubeProgrammer CLI tool) to easily program the TFM into device
internal flash in one shot:</p>
<pre><code>EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\TFM_UPDATE.bat
MDK-ARM:      TFM_SBSFU_Boot\MDK-ARM\TFM_UPDATE.bat
STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\TFM_UPDATE.sh</code></pre>
<p><b>5. Reset the board</b></p>
<p>Press the board reset button, and check the log information on the
terminal emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>TFM_SBSFU_Boot application starts</li>
<li>Then it configures the static protections (because ‘development
mode’ is used by default)</li>
<li>Then it get locked (because intrusion is detected)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. Unlock the board</b></p>
<p>To exit from locked state (intrusion), remove the jumper JP3 (IDD) on
the board, then put it back in place. Check the log information:</p>
<ul>
<li>TFM_SBSFU_Boot starts</li>
<li>Then it checks the static protections, and sets the dynamic
protections</li>
<li>Then it initializes the BL2 NV area (BootLoader2 Non Volatile
area)</li>
<li>Then it verifies the TFM application image signatures.</li>
<li>Then it jumps to the TFM application, displaying the User
Application Main menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>7. Use User App</b></p>
<p>This user application gives access to a Main menu:</p>
<pre><code>   1 - Test protections
   2 - Test TFM Secure services
   3 - New Fw Image

<p><b>9. Configuration</b></p>
<p>It is possible to change TFM configuration. When changing
configuration, all the projects must be cleaned then fully rebuild.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crypto-scheme</strong></p>
<p>By default, the crypto scheme is RSA-2048 signature, and AES-CTR-128
image encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted. It is possible to select
another crypto-scheme, with CRYPTO_SCHEME define in
TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Inc_config\mcuboot_config.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048    0x0 /* RSA-2048 signature, AES-CTR-128 encryption with key RSA-OAEP encrypted */

#define CRYPTO_SCHEME            CRYPTO_SCHEME_RSA2048  /* Select one of available crypto schemes */</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>HW accelerated cryptography</strong></p>
<p>By default, the cryptography is accelerated with the HW crypto
peripherals of the device (PKA, AES, HASH). It is possible to disable it
in mcuboot by commenting BL2_HW_ACCEL_ENABLE define in
TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Inc\config-boot.h.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is possible to disable it in TFM crypto service by
commenting TFM_HW_ACCEL_ENABLE define in
TFM_Appli\Secure\Inc\tfm_mbedcrypto_config.h.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encryption</strong></p>
<p>By default, the image encryption support is enabled. It is possible
to disable the image encryption support with MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES define
in TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Inc\mcuboot_config\mcuboot_config.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES           /* Defined: Image encryption enabled. */</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of images</strong></p>
<p>By default, 2 firmware app images are managed with 2 distincts
signatures: 1 image for NS app binary and 1 image for S app binary. It
is possible to assemble NS and S app binaries into 1 image with 1 single
signature, with MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER define in
Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_APP_IMAGE_NUMBER 1 /* 1: S and NS application binaries are assembled in one single image.
                                      2: Two separated images for S and NS application binaries. */</code></pre>
<p>By default, 1 firmware secure data image and 1 firmware non secure
data image are managed with same signatures as respectively secure app
image and non secure app image. It is possible to remove the data
images, with MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER and
MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER defines in Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_S_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1   /* 1: S data image for S application.
                                           0: No S data image. */

#define MCUBOOT_NS_DATA_IMAGE_NUMBER 1  /* 1: NS data image for NS application.
                                           0: No NS data image. */</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of slots per image</strong></p>
<p>By default, primary and secondary slot configuration is used (for
each image). In this mode, the local loader downloads encrypted image in
secondary slot, and the TFM_SBSFU_Boot decrypts the image when
installing it from secondary slot to primary slot. It is possible to
configure the TFM_SBSFU_Boot to use primary slot only. In this mode, the
local loader downloads encrypted image directly in primary slot, and the
TFM_SBSFU_Boot decrypts in place the image during installation
process.</p>
<p>This is configured with MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY define in
Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_PRIMARY_ONLY       /* Defined: No secondary (download) slot(s), only primary slot(s) for each image.
                                      Undefined: Primary and secondary slot(s) for each image. */</code></pre>
<p>Note: When primary and secondary slot configuration is selected, a
menu item (#3) ‘Download a new Fw Image’ is present in user application.
Its usage is exactly the same as the local loader application. When
primary only slot configuration is selected, this menu item is not
present in user application, it is not possible to download new Fw image
from user application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image upgrade strategy</strong></p>
<p>The bootloader supports either swap- or overwrite-based image
upgrades, for primary and secondary slots configuration. In
overwrite-based image upgrade mode, the image in secondary slot is
overwriting image in primary slot. In swap-based image upgrade mode,
images in primary and secondary slots are swapped. After swap, new image
in primary slot has to be confirmed by user application, else at next
boot the images will be swapped back.</p>
<p>It is possible to select image upgrade strategy with
MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY define in Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY     /* Defined: the FW installation uses overwrite method.
                                      UnDefined: The FW installation uses swap mode. */</code></pre>
<p>Note: When overwrite method is selected, the User App menu ‘New Fw
Image’ only allows to download image. When swap method is selected, this
User App menu additionally allows to validate installed image, and to
request re-installation of image that have been swapped back.</p>
<p>Note: When image is swapped back into download area, image is
re-encrypted (if initially encrypted).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local loader</strong></p>
<p>By default, local loader application is included. It is possible to
remove it with MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER define in Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define MCUBOOT_EXT_LOADER         /* Defined: Add external local loader application. To enter it, press user button at reset.
                                      Undefined: No external local loader application. */</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the build of TFM_Loader must be skipped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application RoT</strong></p>
<p>By default App RoT is enabled in TFM secure application. It is
possible to disable it with TFM_PARTITION_APP_ROT define in
Linker\flash_layout.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define TFM_PARTITION_APP_ROT       /* comment to remove APP_ROT partition */</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Anti-tamper</strong></p>
<p>By default the anti-tamper is enabled for both internal and external
tamper events. It is possible to change this configuration with
TFM_TAMPER_ENABLE define in TFM_SBSFU_Boot\Inc\boot_hal_cfg.h.</p>
<pre><code>#define NO_TAMPER            (0)                /*!&lt; No tamper activated */
#define INTERNAL_TAMPER_ONLY (1)                /*!&lt; Only Internal tamper activated */
#define ALL_TAMPER           (2)                /*!&lt; Internal and External tamper activated */
#define TFM_TAMPER_ENABLE ALL_TAMPER            /*!&lt; TAMPER configuration flag  */</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>STSAFE</strong></p>
<p>By default, TFM application works without an external secure element.
It is possible to rely on it by adding PSA_USE_SE_ST compile switch in
TFM_Appli Secure project (to which STSAFE is connected to) and in
TFM_Appli Non Secure project (to which STSAFE is addressed through PSA
APIs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>10. Keys management</b></p>
<p>It is important to avoid using default keys provided in the example.
A random keys generator is provided for each toolchain:</p>
<pre><code>    EWARM:        TFM_SBSFU_Boot\EWARM\keygen.bat
    MDK-ARM:      TFM_SBSFU_Boot\MDK-ARM\keygen.bat
    STM32CubeIDE: TFM_SBSFU_Boot\STM32CubeIDE\keygen.sh
</code></pre>
<p><b>11. TrustZone deactivation</b></p>
<p>After having executed this application, the TZEN option bit is set.
TZEN option bit must be reset to allow execution of any other non
TrustZone application. To perform that, refer to AN5347.</p>
