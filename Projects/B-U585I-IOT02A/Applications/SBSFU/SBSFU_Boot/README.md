## <b>Application Licence Clarification</b>

The SBSFU_Boot application is licenced by ST under Ultimate Liberty license SLA0044.

## <b>SBSFU_Boot Application description</b>

This project is used to generate the SBSFU_Boot binary file.
The core function of this application relies on the mcuboot middleware, the trusted
firmware (TFM) middleware (only Boot Loader stage 2 part) and the mbed-crypto middleware.

It has to be compiled first.

In order to ease the development process, a prebuild command and postbuild command are
integrated in each toolchain project.
The prebuild command is in charge of preparing the scatter file according to common
flash layout description in linker folder.
The postbuild command is in charge of preparing the board programming scripts and
the images preparation scripts according to the flash layout and crypto scheme.
